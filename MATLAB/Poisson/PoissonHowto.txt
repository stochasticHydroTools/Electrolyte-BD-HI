In order to run the fast solver for the Poisson equation in a doubly periodic domain, simply run the file DPSlab.m. The section marked "input parameters" in DPSlab.m is where you specify the dielectric constants, width of the Gaussian cloud charges, Ewald parameter, and other physical parameters (see comments therein).

Note that there are 2 versions of the code. The version with Ewald splitting uses the files DPSlab.m and DPSlabMain.m. There is also a version without Ewald splitting (slower and equivalent to the version with Ewald splitting) that is in DoublyPeriodicCharges.m
