This folder contains functions which are used in doubly periodic Poisson and Stokes flow. 
BVPChebInt.m - solves the BVP y''-k^2*y=f for the Chebyshev coefficients of y''
BCRows.m - generates the boundary condition rows for the matrix solve
firstIntegralMatrix.m - generates a sparse tridiagonal matrix that maps the coefficients of the second derivative 
to those of the first derivative
secondIntegralMatrix.m - generates a sparse pentadiagonal matrix that maps the coefficients of the second derivative 
to those of the function itself
preComputeInts.m - precomputes the integrals of Chebyshev polynomials for later use
SpreadWts.m - forms the spread and interpolation matrices via fast gaussian gridding in x and y
clencurt.m - file from Trefethen's book that computes the Chebyshev nodes and quadrature wts
ftransform.m - data to coefficients on the grid 
btransform.m - coefficients to data on the grid 
spread.m - spread from points to grid using the spread matrix computed in SpreadWts
interpolate.m - interpolate at points from grid using the interpolation matrix computed in SpreadWts
coeffInt.m - code to apply first integral matrix with a loop
